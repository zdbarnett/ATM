# ATM
This is a python3 code that stemmed from a project in Codio using conditional statements.

In the code you have 3 key functions that are defined using the def function. We defined balance, deposit, and withdraw. 
Once we defined the function for balance, deposit, and withdraw we create code requesting user input. B=balance, D=deposit, and W=withdraw.
Depending on the user input, one of the functions are called. 
The code is written so that a user must pick an option or press Q to quit, closing off all dead ends.
