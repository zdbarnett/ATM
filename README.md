# ATM
This is a python3 code that stemmed from a project in Codio using conditional statements.

In the code you have 3 key functions that are defined using the def function. We defined balance, deposit, and withdraw. 
Once we defined the function for balance, deposit, and withdraw we create code requesting user input. B=balance, D=deposit, and W=withdraw.
Depending on the user input, one of the functions are called. 
The code is written so that a user must pick an option or press Q to quit, closing off all dead ends. 
I want to include a way to save the account balance so that it is updated like you would do with a list and the append function. 
I would also like to find a way to put this into a loop and have 'Q' exit the loop and end the script as it does now. 
The loop would be so that customers can perform multiple actions in one interaction with the ATM (like a real ATM)
If you want to read the code that has comments, I would suggest copying and pasting it into Pycharm. It looks much cleaner.
